<!-- To add a library to cdnjs, it must have a way for an auto-update mechanism
to be used. This can either be via a Git repository that has versions tagged,
with the required files included in the repository at the tag. Or, this can be
done via an NPM package. -->

<!-- cdnjs has a basic popularity requirement for libraries being added.
Please ensure the library you are requesting has at least 800 downloads per
